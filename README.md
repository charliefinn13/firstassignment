<p>Hey everyone! I’m a 28-year-old rural kid that’s moved to the big city (Melbourne) about 6-7 years ago. I finished year 11 in high school (much regret) and haven’t studied since then (going on 11 years now). I was diagnosed with type one <i>diabetes</i> when I was 4 years old, been in and out of hospital a few times since but I’m finally on my way to getting my BSL sorted. I’ve also been struggling with a whole lotta mental illness’ since around the age of 14, which is why I’ve struggled with keeping my diabetes in check.

  

I’ve recently gotten into Pokémon card collecting and although I have quite a few boxes of binders (plus an uncontrollable amount of bulk cards) I’ve hardly scratched the surface of <i>‘catching them all’</i>. As a kid I played a lot of Yu-gi-oh with friends but wasn’t expose to any other trading card games. I was raised on a PlayStation 1 so even the realm of Nintendo wasn’t a thing for me growing up. Since then, I’ve leveled up and scored myself a switch and am finally in the world of Zelda and Mario games. Since a kid I’ve found the calming aspect to gaming, taking myself out of the current real life reality and either pretending I was this super <i>fantastic</i> skateboarder like Tony Hawk or Dave Mirra doing double backflips.

  

<h2 style="colour:CDE7BE;"><b>Interest in IT</b></h2> 

<p>As I mentioned above, my <i>first</i> exposure to technology (besides the TV itself) was video game consoles. I never really questioned how they were made but I was really interested in creating skateparks and areas to use in the games I played, sparking an interest. I liked the idea of control over something I created and then using it the way I felt it was meant to be. Not long after HDMI was introduced, I found myself to be the one in the household to be changing and finding certain cords to do certain things. I liked the idea of playing around with something to figure out what setting was the best, and then seeing the look on my mum's face when she assumed I was performing magic as it made no sense to her.</p> 

  

<p>I chose RMIT as I’ve heard nothing but good things about this university. As well as it being fully online really appealed to me. Although covid has kind of settled and I’m fully vaccinated, it’s best I stay out of public as much as possible as I'm immunocompromised.</p> 

  

<p>I am hoping to learn the ins and outs of technology. Maybe not everything but I’d love to have the knowledge on how to install, trouble shoot and manage phones and computers. I’ve been in many situations where my PS4 has either overheated, my phone has fallen in the toilet and my computer is needing a GPU upgrade to support the games I’m playing. So being able to know what to do and how to do it would benefit me and my life style, as well as my friends and family.</p> 

  

<h2 style="colour:CDE7BE;"><b>Ideal Job</b></h2> 

<p>Computer Workshop Technician</p> 

  

<p>A <i>typical</i> day in the life of Computer Technician would involve anything from installing new software onto computers and building a PC from the ground up. This job covers many aspects of the IT industry that I’m interested in. I’m a very hands-on person so building PCs is right down my alley. I love helping people and the feeling of success when I’ve been able to repair or update someone's device would mean I’ve had a successful day.</p> 

  

<p>You’d need knowledge in troubleshooting, various accounting and computer systems, PC hardware and build specification, repairs as well as great communication skills.</p> 

  

<p>I know the basics of computing. I’ve been able to take apart many of my devices to clean dust out for better performance. I’m familiar with some simple commands to get to a certain file/application within a device.</p> 

  

  <p>I’m hoping to complete and <i>pass</i> the bachelor of IT to further my knowledge on trouble shooting, navigating different software and systems, repairing and updating systems and their settings. After this I hope to find an internship when I’m taught the hardware of all and any device to then be able to <i>build</i> a PC.</p>

<h2 style="colour:CDE7BE;"><b>Project Idea</b></h2> 

<p>With the concept of scanning items, you’ll be given an array of information based on how many carbohydrates are involved in eating certain things. This will then translate into the insulin needed for the amount you enter into the application. Every 15g of carbs equals 1 unit on insulin, which is quite a straight forward request, although when there’s more than one ingredient (some being less than 15g), it can be quite daunting to calculate and think about what you’re eating. By entering the amounts of all ingredients, the app will produce a table of what you’re intaking (e.g % of Carbs, % of sugars etc.).</p>  

  

<p>I’m wanting this application to be as easy and handy as they come. This app would be incorporated with a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) to give advice on what to do and how much to eat based off of your BSL (blood sugar levels). Carbohydrate counting is something we all have to learn, but at times it can be very time consuming and a bit frustrating when you’ve been made to do math calculations in your head before every meal. This can be seen as much easier than figuring out your dose only based on your levels. By having your current levels and patterns connected to this app, it’ll make it easier by explaining what to give yourself based on those levels, creating more personal advice.</p>   

  

<p>After each scanned entry, the app will log and keep all information. This will allow you to go back, select a product and then enter how much you’ll be eating. Not only will it log what you’ve scanned but it’ll give you other suggestions based on what others have scanned. This will make going to the supermarket or a restaurant much easier and there will be less time scanning and calculating things. I believe it’ll be helpful with writing up recipes and if adjustments are necessary, you’re one click away from accommodating this.</p>  

  

<p>As you scan and store food items, you’ll also be able to store your insulin intake. Long are the days that we use a tabled booklet that gives space for writing your levels and insulin intake, but with this app you’ll be able to log all of these things including how often you sleep and exercise to then show your doctor. It’s a pain in the butt having to write down what you done and eaten everyday but because you’re using this app to help with insulin intake, after clicking a suggestion for this, it’ll keep it safe and sound within the app for later use.</p>   

  

<p>The tools and technologies I think would be appropriate for this app is a website called Appery.io. It’s a multi-purpose platform for low-code app development. As I'm a complete novice within this app development world, using this website would make the creation much easier. It uses the speed of drag and drop functionality as well as JavaScript to speed up the process. You’re able to use integrated back-end services such as server-side scripting, push notifications, cloud database plus many more. Using this within a team environment is also facilitated as you can each work on the project in real time but using the website.</p>  

  

<p>The skills needed are minimal if we were to use the website above, but if we were to avoid using such a thing, we’d need quite a few skills. Programming an app is one of the first things (after deciding on the apps use) we’d need. Figuring out how and when things occur once you enter a page or enter your food intake is exactly how this app will fun. After this we’d want to learn and complete the product design. From a logo, to a colour pallet for the whole app, to fonts and setting out the easiest way to access all aspects of the app.</p>  

  

<p>My hopes for the outcome of this application are that those who struggle with their BSL will soon feel confident enough in how to manage them. Going out to restaurants will no longer require you to eat the same thing every time, expanding on your food intake and having complete trust in yourself to keep your levels in the green zone.</p>
